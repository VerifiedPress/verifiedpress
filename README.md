# 📰 VerifiedPress.org

**VerifiedPress is a decentralized trust framework for verifiable digital media and public communication.**  
We empower publishers, journalists, and civic institutions to issue and verify tamper-evident claims using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). By embedding provenance, authenticity, and trust into editorial workflows, VerifiedPress helps rebuild legitimacy in the digital public square.

## 🔍 Why VerifiedPress?

In an era of misinformation, synthetic content, and eroding public trust, VerifiedPress.org provides a transparent, cryptographically backed infrastructure for validating **who said what, when, and why it matters**.

This project is:

- **Open** – Built on W3C standards like [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [VC](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
- **Modular** – Powered by [Veramo](https://veramo.io/), with extensible schemas and issuer policies
- **Civic-Focused** – Designed for journalists, publishers, nonprofits, and institutions that value information integrity
