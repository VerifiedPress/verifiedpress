# 🤝 Contributing to VerifiedPress.org

Welcome! VerifiedPress.org is an open trust framework for cryptographically verifiable media.  
We invite developers, designers, researchers, and civic technologists to help us build tools, standards, and infrastructure for digital trust.

## 🧭 Our Mission

VerifiedPress.org aims to:

- Establish interoperable schemas for press and publisher credentials
- Enable decentralized identity verification for media and civic institutions
- Foster open, auditable, and consent-based credential workflows

Your contributions help ensure that editorial provenance and digital authenticity remain public goods.

## 🛠️ How You Can Contribute

We welcome help in any of the following areas:

- **Code**: Veramo integration, credential workflows, schema validation, revocation logic
- **Docs & Diagrams**: Governance explanations, issuer onboarding, trust registry architecture
- **UX/UI**: Issuer portal, CMS plugins, credential viewer interfaces
- **Ideas & Standards**: New schemas, VC formats, governance improvements, VCIP proposals
- **Testing**: Security, accessibility, compatibility audits

Don’t worry if you’re not a cryptography expert—clarity, usability, and ethics matter just as much.
